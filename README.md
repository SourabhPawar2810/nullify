# nullify

This repository is the home to all code (and data) related to the official website of the Northeastern chapter of [null](https://null.community/).

## Tech Stack
The website is built with [Hugo](https://gohugo.io), a popular static site generator written in [Go](https://go.dev/). All the data displayed on the website is stored in `.md` files or `.yaml` files.

The website is deployed using [Cloudfare pages](https://pages.cloudflare.com/). This makes the website highly secure and available in different regions, significantly improving performance.

## What's different?

There are a couple of things that we are proud about regarding our website.

- The website is highly user privacy centric and minimalistic, allowing you to easily grasp what we are trying to convey.

- We have tried to keep out any and all Javascript from the codebase, which implies that the website will be fully functional even if all scripts are blocked on your browser.
