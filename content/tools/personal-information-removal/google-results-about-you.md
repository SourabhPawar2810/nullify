- Track status of removal requests (In progress, Approved, Denied, Undone)
- Get notified when new results with your personal info appear
- Direct process to remove contact information and other personal data
- Built-in guidance on how removal requests are reviewed

The tool is particularly useful for:
- Removing sensitive personal contact information
- Managing your digital footprint

While removal from Google Search doesn't remove content from the original source, this tool provides a straightforward way to reduce visibility of your personal information online.
